To install TBD

Download to desired directory and run from the Lituus/lituus directory. Preferred
method is to add this to the python sys path by creating a file "lituus.pth" in
the python dist-packages directory with a single line containing the full path of
Lituus

On my Linux (Ubuntu) machine the full path to put the .pth file is
  /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
check documentation for your Operating System, Distro (where applicable) and Python version
