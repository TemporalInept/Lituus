12. What words/phrases are we missing for sequences?

16. Can we just standarize a regular expression to catch anamolies in function word_hacks?

37. planeswalkers

40. Need to write save deck functionality

41. Have to see how Companion will be treated i.e. as one of the 100 or an extra

52. How to handle cards like Transmutation "switch target creature's power and toughness" so that power and toughnes are not combined into p/t

57. Ivory Guardians has object characteristic object phrase will probably see
a lot becuase the first object is a token

71. Add a english i.e. ASCII field for names like Lim-dul's vault

76. Add support for flip lands from Ixalan, and other new land types from last 3 sets

90. Consider changing some cost related tags to 'xr'

96. See Soul Separator it reads "... with power equal to that card's power and toughness equal to that card's toughness" which results in "power and toughness" being combined. This will happen to Kalitas, Bloodchief of Ghet 
xr<power> op<≡> xq<that> ob<card suffix='s> xr<p/t> op<≡> xq<that> ob<card suffix='s> xr<toughness> 

108. Going to have to figure out when to transpose conjunctions from AND to OR i.e. with Blind Obedience, Mox Amber there is an implied 'all' or 'each' with Decree of Annihilation there is a 'all' quanitifier (inside or after conjunction_chain) Luminesce black and red

110. pr<top> ob<card> here top should be a quantifier

113. Life and Limb has two all quanitifiers.

114. Wandering Mage "...xp<player> or ch<planeswalker>..." How do we want to handle it?
 o Cards like Martyrdom, Captain's Maneuver are going to present a problem " target creature, planeswalker, or player"

127. See Silumgar Monument
'{t}: xa<add> {u} or {b}.\n{4}{u}{b}: ob<card ref=self> xa<become suffix=s> xq<a> ob<permanent characteristics=creature→(4/4∧blue∧black∧(artifact∧dragon))> pr<with> kw<flying> sq<until> ts<eot>.'
 we can unwrap the inner artifact&dragon

130. if we tag standalone characteristics as 'xr', we will have to change up how we treat objects

133. Jhoira's Timebug will cause problems

136, Need to figure out how to standarize the treatment of suffixes in status

137. Look at Sieges i.e. Monastery Siege, have to tag khans or dragons 

146. Tag mode? appears in a few cards (outside of reminder text)

153. High Seas, good example of grouping

155. Votes i.e. Coercive Portal have to tag them similar to 137

157. Land Equilibrium >= followed by "as many" have to do something about this

162. How to handle possessives i.e. Trickbind

164. Tag random (106) cases

165. Tag order? (212 cases)

166. Tag the phrase in any order? (144) vs in a random order? (63) or leave as is?

170. see Raging River, left pile was translated to xa<leave suffix=ed> pile

171. Losing the suffix on +n/+n counters

172. What to do about "color or colors". do we lose meaning if condense to just colors

175. For partner with, after graphing do we want to replace id with actual Card Name

179. Should we move ability word definition into the 'main' body of the tree?

182. See Shimatsu the Bloodcloaked, how do we tie "that many +1/+1 counters in the second sentence back to the "any number of" in the first sentence

183. See Aquamorph Entity has two replacement effect clauses ETB and turned face up

188. should be tagging 'life'

189. Look at "for each" (pr<for> xq<each>) there are at 900+ of these

190. Need a better way of labeling nodes related to APC. We want an easy way to search for alternate/reduced costs

191. only during restrictions...

193. move apc related to seperate function

194. Having issues no with Gobling Bangchuckers. The line itself has two conditionals
 and would require splitting the line in order to graph correctly

195. Until a search function is implemented in the tree could we use list_utils to search in the list of nodes (tree.nodes)?
 For example in Seachrome coast the depth first order of nodes is 
['root', 'static-line:0', 'replacement-effect:0', 'etb-continuous:0', 'permanent:0', 'ungraphed-sentence:0', 'effect:0', 'conditional:0', 'status-unless:0', 'status:0', 'condition:0', 'ungraphed-sentence:1', 'activated-ability:0', 'activated-cost:0', 'ungraphed-sentence:2', 'activated-effect:0', 'ungraphed-sentence:3']
we can use list_util to splice [etb-continuous, ... ,effect, ..., status-unless] and identifies cards that enter the battlefield tapped unless ...  

201. In Xenagos, God of Revels, xenagos is not being self-reffed  because xenagos is a planeswalker subtype because of Xenagos, the Reveler

202. Finish rather-than clauses 

203. Six except for/by exceptions (Flame Sweep, Akron Legionnaire, Keldon Firebombers, Inspire Awe)

205. except it are more clauses than full phrases

207. Bound by Moonsilver has an example of a or chain for action words in first non keyword line and an example of a 'could' clause

208. for modes see Atalya, Samite Master, need to break these up as clauses and graph each clause as a 'mode'

210. add ability in mtgt to print from a given node as well

211. Have to make sure we have all APC phrasing covered
 - under APC need to specify the spell as well. in most cases it is the card but in others like Dream Halls the spell needs to be laid out

212. action clause is too broad and will graph phrases that are not action clauses

215. see Harbinger of the Tides - has an 'if' mid clause (action clause) Saproling Symbiosis is the same
 │   └─as-though:0
 │     └─action:1
 │       ├─thing:1
 │       │ └─it:0 (type=lituus-object)
 │       └─have:0
 │         └─action-params:1 (tograph=kw<flash> cn<if> xp<you> xa<pay> {2} xl<more> pr<to> ka<cast> xo<it>)


216. should we graph "then if" as if-then structure?

221. See Okk, will have to add suffix to the action words

222. See Okk
CURRENT
<Okk>
 ├─static-line:0
 │ └─cannot:0
 │   ├─thing:0
 │   │ └─mtg-object:0 (value=card)
 │   │   └─ref:0 (value=self)
 │   ├─action:0
 │   │ └─attack:0
 │   └─unless:0

ALTERNATE
<Okk>
 ├─static-line:0
 │ └─cannot:0
 │   ├─action:0
 │   │ ├─attack:0
 │   │ └─thing:0
 │   │   └─mtg-object:0 (value=card)
 │   │    └─ref:0 (value=self)
 │   └─unless:0
 ....

would the second be better?

228. have to tag kind (it's sorta of a meta charactersitic)

229. do we need a special case for etb when graphing action clauses under triggered-abilities see Abyssal Horror

230. for sequences need to add a capture for stuff like "the next time"
 o see Awe Strike - is it better to capture the sequence in the replacement effect or 
  allow the line to fail until we can implement clauses and break into comma separated

233. For APC, have to look at condition, this spells costs X less to cast see Discountinuity from Core 2021

234. In Charming Prince, the triggered instruction only applies to the last mode/option. What can we do about this

235. Anafenza, the Foremost xq<a> ob<card characteristics=creature> cn<not> pr<on> xq<the> zn<battlefield>
 o have to figure out how to break down/separate the thing from the qualifying clause

236. Aluren has a hanging 'and' after graphing as 'may as-though'

238. What to do about suffix in Things, should we append to the main tag or leave as a attribute i.e. 
 'creatures' = ob<permanent characteristics=creature>
 we could graph as 
 permanents
  -characteristics value=creature
 or
 permanent
  -characteristics value=creatures
 or leave as is
 permanent
  -suffix value=s
  -charateristics value=creature

239. See Hanweir Garrison, do we need support for "that are" ... in graph_thing

240. Vindictive Lich is not being parsed as modal due to the way triggered-abilities are handled. "choose one or more." is graphed as the triggered effect and the remainder is graphed as the triggered instructions

241. Need a path function in mtgt: find the path from s to t, determine if t is in a path
from s
