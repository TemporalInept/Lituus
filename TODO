12. What words/phrases are we missing for sequences?

16. Can we just standarize a regular expression to catch anamolies in function word_hacks?

40. Need to write save deck functionality

41. Have to see how Companion will be treated i.e. as one of the 100 or an extra

52. How to handle cards like Transmutation "switch target creature's power and toughness" so that power and toughnes are not combined into p/t

57. Ivory Guardians has object characteristic object phrase will probably see
a lot becuase the first object is a token

71. Add a english i.e. ASCII field for names like Lim-dul's vault

76. Add support for flip lands from Ixalan, and other new land types from last 3 sets

90. Consider changing some cost related tags to 'xr'

96. See Soul Separator it reads "... with power equal to that card's power and toughness equal to that card's toughness" which results in "power and toughness" being combined. This will happen to Kalitas, Bloodchief of Ghet 
xr<power> op<≡> xq<that> ob<card suffix='s> xr<p/t> op<≡> xq<that> ob<card suffix='s> xr<toughness> 

108. Going to have to figure out when to transpose conjunctions from AND to OR i.e. with Blind Obedience, Mox Amber there is an implied 'all' or 'each' with Decree of Annihilation there is a 'all' quanitifier (inside or after conjunction_chain) Luminesce black and red

110. pr<top> ob<card> here top should be a quantifier

113. Life and Limb has two all quanitifiers.

114. Wandering Mage "...xp<player> or ch<planeswalker>..." How do we want to handle it?
 o Cards like Martyrdom, Captain's Maneuver are going to present a problem " target creature, planeswalker, or player"

127. See Silumgar Monument
'{t}: xa<add> {u} or {b}.\n{4}{u}{b}: ob<card ref=self> xa<become suffix=s> xq<a> ob<permanent characteristics=creature→(4/4∧blue∧black∧(artifact∧dragon))> pr<with> kw<flying> sq<until> ts<eot>.'
 we can unwrap the inner artifact&dragon

130. if we tag standalone characteristics as 'xr', we will have to change up how we treat objects

133. Jhoira's Timebug will cause problems

136, Need to figure out how to standarize the treatment of suffixes in status

137. Look at Sieges i.e. Monastery Siege, have to tag khans or dragons 

146. Tag mode? appears in a few cards (outside of reminder text)

153. High Seas, good example of grouping

155. Votes i.e. Coercive Portal have to tag them similar to 137

157. Land Equilibrium >= followed by "as many" have to do something about this

162. How to handle possessives i.e. Trickbind

164. Tag random (106) cases

165. Tag order? (212 cases)

166. Tag the phrase in any order? (144) vs in a random order? (63) or leave as is?

170. see Raging River, left pile was translated to xa<leave suffix=ed> pile

172. What to do about "color or colors". do we lose meaning if condense to just colors

175. For partner with, after graphing do we want to replace id with actual Card Name

179. Should we move ability word definition into the 'main' body of the tree?

182. See Shimatsu the Bloodcloaked, how do we tie "that many +1/+1 counters in the second sentence back to the "any number of" in the first sentence

183. See Aquamorph Entity has two replacement effect clauses ETB and turned face up

188. should be tagging 'life'

190. Need a better way of labeling nodes related to APC. We want an easy way to search for alternate/reduced costs

191. only during restrictions...

194. Having issues no with Gobling Bangchuckers. The line itself has two conditionals
 and would require splitting the line in order to graph correctly

201. In Xenagos, God of Revels, xenagos is not being self-reffed  because xenagos is a planeswalker subtype because of Xenagos, the Reveler

207. Bound by Moonsilver has an example of a or chain for action words in first non keyword line and an example of a 'could' clause

210. add ability in mtgt to print from a given node as well

211. Have to make sure we have all APC phrasing covered
 - under APC need to specify the spell as well. in most cases it is the card but in others like Dream Halls the spell needs to be laid out

212. action clause is too broad and will graph phrases that are not action clauses

221. See Okk, will have to add suffix to the action words

228. have to tag kind (it's sorta of a meta charactersitic)

229. do we need a special case for etb when graphing action clauses under triggered-abilities see Abyssal Horror

230. for sequences need to add a capture for stuff like "the next time"
 o see Awe Strike - is it better to capture the sequence in the replacement effect or 
  allow the line to fail until we can implement clauses and break into comma separated

233. For APC, have to look at condition, this spells costs X less to cast see Discountinuity from Core 2021

235. Anafenza, the Foremost xq<a> ob<card characteristics=creature> cn<not> pr<on> xq<the> zn<battlefield>
 o have to figure out how to break down/separate the thing from the qualifying clause

236. Aluren has a hanging 'and' after graphing as 'may as-though'

239. See Hanweir Garrison, do we need support for "that are" ... in graph_thing

240. Vindictive Lich is not being parsed as modal due to the way triggered-abilities are handled. "choose one or more." is graphed as the triggered effect and the remainder is graphed as the triggered instructions

241. Need a path function in mtgt: find the path from s to t, determine if t is in a path
from s

242. Bronze Bombshell - thing clause consists of "a player other than Bronze Bombshell's owner" - won't be graphed as thing

245. See Rimescale Dragon
     │ ├─with:0
     │ └─with:1 (tograph=pr<with> xo<ctr type=ice suffix=s> pr<on> xo<them>)
     └─do:0
       └─action-params:2 (tograph=cn<not> ka<untap> sq<during> xq<their> xp<controller suffix=s'> ts<untap suffix=s>)
 where is the empty with coming from
 
246. See Rimescale Dragon (see above) the dont is not being translated to a do-not node which highlights a bigger issuer where an action word is immediately followed by a conditional

247. See Rally the Horde - the last exile is a status ("If the last card exiled isn't a land card, repeat this process"

248. See Undertow have to tag islandwalk inside text since it becomes "pr<with> ob<permanent characteristics=land→island> kw<landwalk>"

249. See Teferi's Moat things may have more than one preposition clause
 - re.compile(r"pr<(\w+)> ").split(test) does split into a list of [prep,clause,...,prep,clause]

251. Made a handjam hack for coin counters (Athereos) since coins are tagged first as lituus objects

254. Might have to relook etb-with and allow the with to pass into successive graphing see Academy elite

255. Have to redo landwalks see Livonya Silone. xr<super-type val=legendary> kw<landwalk> need to standarize this so landwalks are the same: ob<permanent characteristics=land→plains> kw<landwalk> (Great Wall)

259. See Chakram Retriever - incorrectly self-tagged kw<partner> pr<with> ob<card ref=self> slinger

260. Have to redo graph_action clause. Need to grab all players such as Oblation 
 xq<the> xp<owner> pr<of> xq<target> ob<permanent characteristics=¬land> ka<shuffle suffix=s>
the phrase upto shuffle is a thing (player)
 - however, if we can graph the of clause we would have:
   └─action:0
     ├─thing:0
     │ ├─quantifier:0 (value=the)
     │ ├─player:0 (value=owner)
     │ └─qualifying-clause:0
     │   └─of:0 
     │    └─thing:1
     │      ├─quantifier:0 (value=target)
     │      └─ob<permanent characteristics=¬land>)
     └─shuffle:0

264. Should 'number' be object, quantifier or both?  

265. Giant Trap Door Spider the qualifying clause only applies to the second item and not to the conjunction

266. See Spark Double cn<not> xr<super-type val=legendary> we should negate the legendary

268. Combine "to be" with subsequent action word?

270. See Stoneshock Giant. Has possessive clause last (as does Plague Engineer)

273. some amplifiers remain, these do not have a preceding zone have to figure out what to do with them see Uba-Mask

274. Have to look at graphing trailing sequence clause i.e. at the end ... turn

275. 603.2d Some trigger events use the word “becomes” (for example, “becomes attached” or “becomes blocked”). These trigger only at the time the named event happens .. 
 o look for statuses

276. Nafs Asp is tricky wording

238. Deadlock Trap, Interdict, have "activate this turn", will have to go back and make sure "this turn" is being graphed --> ADD to trailing clause search

240. Do we want to continue combining "end of combat" Vebulid and "beginning of combat" Blood Mist?

241. Some fight actions i.e. Joust only have "each other" and are not graphing

242. Find phrase x plus one and make them nu<x+1> see Kyren Toy

243. "this way" (see also 238) look at keyword actions (lituus too) that have suffixes like 's' and 'ed' how many of these end with 'this way' versus an object etc

244. phrases of the form OPERATOR THING'S ATTRIBUTE

247. Start graphing lituus actions:
    'put','remove','distribute','get','return','draw','move','look','pay','deal','gain','attack','defend','unblock','block','enter','leave','choose','die','spend','unspend','take','reduce','trigger','prevent','declare','have','switch','assign','tie','skip','flip','cycle','phase','become','share','turn','produce','round','resolve','do','repeat','change','bid','select','reselect','begin','separate','note','reorder','copy','named','cost',

252. Something is going wrong now with graphing action-clauses, see Fossil Find

254. Not a big deal but when reminder text at the end of the oracle is removed, hanging newlines can be left behind. Oracle text does not end with a newline.

257. Have to handjam Game of Chaos with ka<double> xq<the> xo<life> stakes pr<with> xq<each> xa<flip>

259 rewrite ability words like Spell mastery, removing the underscore (see Dark Dabbling)

260. do something with trailing qualifiers see Loyal Pegasus

262. See Incite Hysteria, have to figure how to break the action clauses up, that is by action word do we split 

263. Some ifs span multiples sentences, see Once Upon a Time

265. See Lhurgoyf the name was treated as a characteristic

266. See Agent of Treachery, we have 
 "At the beginning of your end step, if you control three or more permanents you don't own, draw three cards."
 - the if clause belongs with the effect (draw three cards) but due to how triggered abilities are being split, it is moved to the condition clause

267. See Three Wishes, when graphing a 'whose', we can remove the possessive suffix, how to do this?

270. Do we want to make and i-node for 'may' i.e. optional value='may'

272. See Pale Moon and graphing of if-instead-of the orginal event is fragmentary and somehow should be part of the 'predicate' clause of the action-clause

273. See Crown of Empires,  Throne of Empires is being tagged as a token

275. See Skullbriar, the Walking Grave, "to any zone other than a player's hand or library" belong to the predicate and not the thing

276. look at 'without', 'with' are there special i-nodes we could create for these?

281. See Abundance, the "you may instead choose land or nonland and reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a card of the chosen kind" is being graphed incorrectly. 

282. See Nyxbloom Ancient the "three times as much" is being treated as a sequence

285. Add loot, rummage, flicker to common phrase replacments

286. See Primal Empathy, the 'otherwise' in triggered-instructions, should be in the triggered-effect clause

287. in actions, need to combine "can action", "that are/is" (Find others)

289. Could clean up some functions like graph_repl_instead due to multiple patterns having the same graphing function

292. Have commented out the fall-back continous etb graphing for now

294. additional costs?

295. See Abandon Reason, 'each' comes after the thing. Could we traonspose this?, remove it?

294. the conjunction in abeyance is being graphed wrong

295. Need to look at graphing trailing sequences see Dawnfluke

296. See Cautery Sliver, the conjunction of things is being split incorrectly

297. Kor Dirge, the conditional phrase, is not being graphing correctly

298. Battlefield Medic is an example of a variable value where the variable is removed from the variable definition

299. See mystic barrier has a conjunction of triggered conditions that are being treated as one delayed trigger ability

300. See Mana Cache, has two consectutive sequences where the second one is being treated as a sequence effect

302. for phase_clauses of the form num time(s) quanitifier phase, I don't like how the limit is being placed in the turn-structure, should somehow be moved up

303. See Angel of Salvation, the sequence/prevent damage subtree should be the triggered effect

304. See Inspire Awe "except by enchanted creatures and enchantment creatures." is being chained as "creature∧enchantment)∧creature" and "enchanted" is being applied to the chain

305. Woolly Razorback has an and separated two distinct phrasing types (prevent and grant)

306. verify Lost Auramancers for correct graphing

307. Reveka, Wizard Savant, the sequence only applies to the "does not untap" and not the whole activated effect

310. Add the attribute sub-tree used in _graph_ap_double_ to all attribute related

312. Still have to add or annotate continuous ETB as part of triggered abilities, i.e. Spawnbroker

313. Don't like graphing of exchange life total

316. Added to-be as a prefix but did not take into account is not verb such as in Nessian Wild Ravager "if tribute was not paid"

319. Bid and Bidding (found in three cards (Illicit Auction, Mages' Contest, Pain's Reward)

320. Angel of Jubilation action-clause conjunction is screwing up because there are two 'or' clauses

322. Wildfire Devils, thought I got rid of graphing location but there is a from node

324. See Liliana of the Dark Realms, dropping the 'for' in 'search your library for a swamp' but no it looks a little off to do so

325. See Kill Switch, need to catch "for as long as", currently is being treated as two separate tokens

326. See Mirri, Weatherlight Duelist, does the restriction phrasing work? 

327. See Fasting we're still getting two 'replacement-effect' nodes
 │ │ └─cond-effect:1
 │ │   └─replacement-effect:0
 │ │     └─repl-new-event:0
 │ │       └─repl-effect:0 (value=instead)

 │ │                   └─phase:1 (value=step)
the first is comming from the if-would-instead, the second from the skip

328. Have to make all graphing of things under a thing-clause (such as reified attributes, qtz phrases etc)

330. Do not like except-for graphing see Season of the Witch

331. See Treasure Keeper, 'grants' an APC which is not being graphed

332. Emblazoned Golem is being graphed incorrectly

333. See Repeated Reverbation "when you next cast"

338. See Sworn Defender, the first sequence-phrase is not being graphed

340. See Price of Betrayal, because we're splitting phrases by commas, we're getting a clause = or xp<opponent>. instead of it being conjoined in the parameter of remove
 - have commented out section breaking sentences into clauses by comma for now which results in no graph of PoB

341. See if there are any "remove ... from the game" in oracle text, if so can we just replace with exile?

344. Having fixed Crystalline Resonance triggered ability graphing - need to make sure it did not break other cards, same goes for the sequences (turn_structure2 is currently commented out)

345. In mana nodes, instead of quantity specifying the number of symbols should change to CMC

346. in grapher, _graph_ap_add_ and _graph_mana_string need a lot of work

347. Removed boundary check (comma) in re_action_clause in action-parameters expression, monitor to make sure nothing breaks

348. Do we really need the act-parameter node?

349. See Gilded Drake should we tag 'make' and 'illegal'

351. 'decision-point' in if_thing_cando graphing needs to be renamed to something more fitting

352. have to look at stuff like "could action" or will it only be related to 'could target'

353. See Wall of Shadows, a lot wrong with the graphing 
 1. 'can' is being graphed as a restriction
 2. target of spells that can target only Walls or of abilities that can target only Walls. This should be:
  target-of
   conjunction 'or'
    spells ...
    abilities ...

354. See Noble Quarry the or is a conjunction of things not action clauses

356. Sequencing still needs work see Incite War, 'this turn' not being graphed as a sequence, Peema Aether-Seer is same as is Alluring Scent
