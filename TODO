2. How to combine/use face converted mana cost in MTGCard

3. Do we need to remove zone from command zone (in tagger)

4. Do we need to switch shuffle your library clause - will now read ", then shuffle your library" rather as a seperate sentence (tagger)

5. Keep replacement of "your opponent(s)" with "opponents" (tagger)?

8. Look for cards like Tolaria, ..."bands with other"... which may/will cause problems with double quoted words

11. Keep cost as a lituus action or redo as a lituus characterisitic?

12. What words/phrases are we missing for sequences?

16. Can we just standarize a regular expression to catch anamolies in function word_hacks?

31. How to self ref "Hazezon" in Hazezon Tamar without self reffing "Dragon" in Dragon Egg (for now, am hacking it in multiverse.py

32. Have to figure where/when/how to combine type + card as in Aberrant Researcher
 "... instant or sorcery card ..."

36. See Guided Passage for 'Thing' chaining

37. Modal spells/abilities, level ups and planeswalkers see Charming Prince

54. Sarpadian Empires, Vol. VII is a good example of 'grouping' vs 'chaining' and needs to be handled prior to 3chain

55. Have to tag choice and named
 o for named, it is generally followed by a card name should we tag it as an action?

57. Ivory Guardians has object characteristic object phrase will probably see
a lot becuase the first object is a token

58. Need to define tags and tag symbols like align

59. looking at Dreams of the Dead and Cavern Harpy, do we want creature->white&black
 - in the case of Cavern Harpy, do we want 
    "blue|black&creature" which if precedence is left to right works but
    "creature->blue|black" is easier
  - brings an interesting observation in the case of Cavern Harpy, there is an
    implied object (as is there is in Terror) and creature is the target of the
    effect

69. Cloudseeder, the last 'cloud sprite' is not being tagged as an object. Is it because of the double quote?

70. Consider adding 'land' whereever there is a standalone 'snow' or 'basic'
