2. How to combine/use face converted mana cost in MTGCard

3. Do we need to remove zone from command zone (in tagger)

4. Do we need to switch shuffle your library clause - will now read ", then shuffle your library" rather as a seperate sentence (tagger)

5. Keep replacement of "your opponent(s)" with "opponents" (tagger)?

8. Look for cards like Tolaria, ..."bands with other"... which may/will cause problems with double quoted words

12. What words/phrases are we missing for sequences?

16. Can we just standarize a regular expression to catch anamolies in function word_hacks?

31. How to self ref "Hazezon" in Hazezon Tamar without self reffing "Dragon" in Dragon Egg (for now, am hacking it in multiverse.py

36. See Guided Passage for 'Thing' chaining

37. Modal spells/abilities, level ups and planeswalkers see Charming Prince

40. Need to write save deck functionality

41. Have to see how Companion will be treated i.e. as one of the 100 or an extra

43. Stangg Twin in card Stangg is being tagged as <obj ref=self> twin - have to fix this

47. How to handle two consecutive objects like Trail of Crumbs "permanent card"

50. Will have to deconflict IKO keyword counters that are incorrectly tagged as 
keywords

52. How to handle cards like Transmutation "switch target creature's power and toughness"

53. Can use the possessive suffix "'s" for some meta characteristics see Sewer Nemesis

54. Sarpadian Empires, Vol. VII is a good example of 'grouping' vs 'chaining' and needs to be handled prior to 3chain

57. Ivory Guardians has object characteristic object phrase will probably see
a lot becuase the first object is a token

59. looking at Dreams of the Dead and Cavern Harpy, do we want creature->white&black
 - in the case of Cavern Harpy, do we want 
    "blue|black&creature" which if precedence is left to right works but
    "creature->blue|black" is easier
  - brings an interesting observation in the case of Cavern Harpy, there is an
    implied object (as is there is in Terror) and creature is the target of the
    effect

66. When we get to singleton characteristics have to take into account landwalk, possibly cycling see Ayumi, the Last Visitor

69. Cloudseeder, the last 'cloud sprite' is not being tagged as an object. Is it because of the double quote?

71. Add a english i.e. ASCII field for names like Lim-dul's vault

72. Have to make sure the subclass operator fits 
 a. Wave of Vitriol goes type<-super
 b. Cautery Sliver goes type<-sub

74. See Elven Riders - the "with flying" only applies to the creatures and not the walls
 Both of these occur in  mtgl.re_2chain_conj

76. Add support for flip lands from Ixalan, and other new land types from last 3 sets

78. In regex patterns for tag-value, remove the "'" single quote as it is only present in attributes
 
81. Have to go back and look at regexes with '\s' and make sure newlines are not causing bad matches

83. for stuff like spectacle cost i.e. Rafter Demon do we need a special tag and how 

84. will have to combine activated and ability as in Training Ground

86. what to do about "highest" as in Juxtapose

88. Tag 'symbol'? see Drought

90. Consider changing some cost related tags to 'xr'

92. See Timesifter "nu<2> or more" - we could change this to "op<>=> nu<2>"

94. Tag forms of "amount of"

95. Need to add and deconflict lituus status

96. See Soul Separator it reads "... with power equal to that card's power and toughness equal to that card's toughness" which results in "power and toughness" being combined. This will happen to Kalitas, Bloodchief of Ghet 
xr<power> op<≡> xq<that> ob<card suffix='s> xr<p/t> op<≡> xq<that> ob<card suffix='s> xr<toughness> 

97. When deleting reminder text, a hanging space is left behind

106. Remember 'draft' cards being a problem last time

107. Still have to tag combat damage, life

108. Going to have to figure out when to transpose conjunctions from AND to OR i.e. with Blind Obedience, Mox Amber there is an implied 'all' or 'each' with Decree of Annihilation there is a 'all' quanitifier (inside or after conjunction_chain)

110. pr<top> ob<card> here top should be a quantifier

111. Nature's Chose "...is ka<untap suffix=ed>..." should be a status. mtgl.re\_status is checking for a preceding "is " and 

112. Kalia of the Vast - tapped and attacking should both be status

113. Life and Limb has two all quanitifiers.

114. Wandering Mage "...xp<player> or ch<planeswalker>..." see this a lot. How do we want to handle it?

115. See Soul Separator currently have ch<creature→zombie∧black> after tagger._clr_type_ should the zombie and black be wrapped i.e. ch<creature→(zombie∧black)> or leave as 

117. Cards like Martyrdom, Captain's Maneuver, Price of Betrayal are going to present a problem " target creature, planeswalker, or player"
