2. How to combine/use face converted mana cost in MTGCard

3. Do we need to remove zone from command zone (in tagger)

4. Do we need to switch shuffle your library clause - will now read ", then shuffle your library" rather as a seperate sentence (tagger)

5. Keep replacement of "your opponent(s)" with "opponents" (tagger)?

8. Look for cards like Tolaria, ..."bands with other"... which may/will cause problems with double quoted words

11. Keep cost as a lituus action or redo as a lituus characterisitic?

12. What words/phrases are we missing for sequences?

16. Can we just standarize a regular expression to catch anamolies in function word_hacks?

18. See Aphetto Runecaster, 'turn' should be tagged as an action word

19. Wasitora, Nekoru Queen highlights many problems

'kw<flying>, kw<trample>\ntp<whenever> ob<card ref=self> xa<deal suffix=s> combat damage pr<to> xq<a> xp<player>, xq<that> xp<player> ka<sacrifice suffix=s> xq<a> ch<creature>. cn<if> the xp<player> cn<cannot>, xp<you> ka<create> xq<a> ch<p/t val=3/3> ch<black>, ch<red>, and ch<green> ch<cat> ch<dragon> ch<creature> ob<token> pr<with> kw<flying>.'

...ka<create> xq<a> ch<p/t val=3/3> ch<black>, ch<red>, and ch<green> ch<cat> ch<dragon> ch<creature> ob<token>
 a. have very distinct chain setup with 7 characteristics,
 b. should types be chained differently from say colors, 
 c. how about meta characteristics like p/t

24. Entity chains like Cautery Sliver

25. Darksteel Mutation

26. Nissa's Defeat, Wasitora, Nekoru Queen and Chrome Mox highlight chaining problems/difficulties

>>> mv["Nissa's Defeat"]._card['tag']
'ka<destroy> xq<target> ch<forest>, ch<green> ch<enchantment>, or ch<green> ch<planeswalker>. cn<if> xq<that> ob<permanent> was xq<a> ch<nissa> ch<planeswalker>, xa<draw> xq<a> ob<card>.'

>>> mv["Wasitora, Nekoru Queen"]._card['tag']
'kw<flying>, kw<trample>\ntp<whenever> ob<card ref=self> xa<deal suffix=s> combat damage pr<to> xq<a> xp<player>, xq<that> xp<player> ka<sacrifice suffix=s> xq<a> ch<creature>. cn<if> the xp<player> cn<cannot>, xp<you> ka<create> xq<a> ch<p/t val=3/3> ch<black∧red∧green> ch<cat> ch<dragon> ch<creature> ob<token> pr<with> kw<flying>.'

>>> mv["Chrome Mox"]._card['tag']
"aw<imprint> — tp<when> ob<card ref=self> xa<enter suffix=s> the zn<battlefield>, xp<you> cn<may> ka<exile> xq<a> ch<¬artifact>, ch<¬land> ob<card> pr<from> xp<you suffix=r> zn<hand>.\n{t}: xa<add> nu<1> xo<mana> of xq<any> of the ka<exile suffix=ed> ob<card suffix='s> ch<color suffix=s>."

a. Nissa has 3 distinct permanents a forest, a green enchantment and a green planeswalker where the quantifier target applies to each but these cannot be chained into a forest|green->enchantment|green->planeswalker (or could they) NOTE: there are no commas between green and enchantment

b. In Chrome Mox we see two characteristics that can be chained into a card object but there is a comma seperating them

c. Wasitora has multiple characterstics with no commas and one meta (p/t)

28. Hazezon Tamar presents a problem with chaining 

31. How to self ref "Hazezon" in Hazezon Tamar without self reffing "Dragon" in Dragon Egg (for now, am hacking it in multiverse.py

32. Have to figure where/when/how to combine type + card as in Aberrant Researcher
 "... instant or sorcery card ..."

36. See Guided Passage for 'Thing' chaining

37. Modal spells/abilities, level ups and planeswalkers see Charming Prince

38. Quest for Ula's Temple creates an implied object 'permanent' when there is
 a specified object 'card'
 a. this is because we have a chain of creature types followed by ch<creature> ob<card>

40. Need to write save deck functionality

41. Have to see how Companion will be treated i.e. as one of the 100 or an extra

43. Stangg Twin in card Stangg is being tagged as <obj ref=self> twin - have to fix this

45. Is rounded (up or down) prevalent enough to tag it?

46. Have to tag damage/combat damage

47. How to handle two consecutive objects like Trail of Crumbs "permanent card"

49. Duplicant - how to handle meta-characteristics that do not have a value attribute

50. Will have to deconflict IKO keyword counters that are incorrectly tagged as 
keywords

51. Lost Legacy ...xa<choose> xq<a> ch<¬artifact>, ch<¬land> ob<card> ch<name>... after chaining will have a hanging characteristic (a meta)

52. How to handle cards like Transmutation "switch target creature's power and toughness"

53. Can use the possessive suffix "'s" for some meta characteristics see Sewer Nemesis

54. Sarpadian Empires, Vol. VII is a good example of 'grouping' vs 'chaining' and needs to be handled prior to 3chain

55. Have to tag choice (as a lituus object?), produce (lituus action?), named (lituus action)

56. See Mana Web, ... is st<tapped> is not deconflicted right, should be 
ka<tap suffix=ed>
