2. How to combine/use face converted mana cost in MTGCard

3. Do we need to remove zone from command zone (in tagger)

4. Do we need to switch shuffle your library clause - will now read ", then shuffle your
          library" rather as a seperate sentence (tagger)

5. Keep replacement of "your opponent(s)" with "opponents" (tagger)?

6. Group all exceptions under a single one?

8. Look for cards like Tolaria, "bands with other" which may/will cause problems
 with double quoted words

10. tag status in 2nd pass?
 Look at Breath of Fury and especially Upwelling for 'standalone' turn structure
 phrases

11. Keep cost as a lituus action or redo as a lituus characterisitic?

12. What words/phrases are we missing for sequences?

13. We're looking at issues for words like tap (and untap), attach (and unattach) 
 phase (is it a turn structure, a keyword phasing, a status phased out or an action
 phases out)

14: unspent (see Upwelling)

15. See below, add in additional is being tagged

>>> mv['Breath of Fury']._card['tag']
'kw<enchant> ch<creature> xp<you> xc<control>\ntp<when> kw<enchant>ed ch<creature> 
xa<deal>s combat damage pr<to> xq<a> xp<player>, ka<sacrifice> xo<it> and ka<attach> 
ob<card ref=self> pr<to> xq<a> ch<creature> xp<you> xc<control>. cn<if> xp<you> do, 
ka<untap> xq<all> ch<creature>s xp<you> xc<control> and sq<after> xq<this> xa<phase>, 
there is xq<a> xa<add>itional ts<combat>.'

also should additional be tagged (possibly as a quantifier)

the problem is in the look ahead, the regex is only looking for the first letter, i.e. 
the 'i' in 'ing'
