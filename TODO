2. How to combine/use face converted mana cost in MTGCard

8. Look for cards like Tolaria, ..."bands with other"... which may/will cause problems with double quoted words

12. What words/phrases are we missing for sequences?

16. Can we just standarize a regular expression to catch anamolies in function word_hacks?

31. How to self ref "Hazezon" in Hazezon Tamar without self reffing "Dragon" in Dragon Egg (for now, am hacking it in multiverse.py

36. See Guided Passage for 'Thing' chaining

37. Modal spells/abilities, level ups and planeswalkers see Charming Prince

40. Need to write save deck functionality

47. How to handle two consecutive objects like Trail of Crumbs "permanent card"
 o align these similar to characteristics?

50. Will have to deconflict IKO keyword counters that are incorrectly tagged as 
keywords

52. How to handle cards like Transmutation "switch target creature's power and toughness"

53. Can use the possessive suffix "'s" for some meta characteristics see Sewer Nemesis

57. Ivory Guardians has object characteristic object phrase will probably see
a lot becuase the first object is a token

71. Add a english i.e. ASCII field for names like Lim-dul's vault

74. See Elven Riders - the "with flying" only applies to the creatures and not the walls
 Both of these occur in  mtgl.re_2chain_conj

76. Add support for flip lands from Ixalan, and other new land types from last 3 sets

78. In regex patterns for tag-value, remove the "'" single quote as it is only present in attributes

83. for stuff like spectacle cost i.e. Rafter Demon do we need a special tag and how 

84. will have to combine activated and ability as in Training Ground

86. what to do about "highest" as in Juxtapose

90. Consider changing some cost related tags to 'xr'

96. See Soul Separator it reads "... with power equal to that card's power and toughness equal to that card's toughness" which results in "power and toughness" being combined. This will happen to Kalitas, Bloodchief of Ghet 
xr<power> op<≡> xq<that> ob<card suffix='s> xr<p/t> op<≡> xq<that> ob<card suffix='s> xr<toughness> 

97. When deleting reminder text, a hanging space is left behind

108. Going to have to figure out when to transpose conjunctions from AND to OR i.e. with Blind Obedience, Mox Amber there is an implied 'all' or 'each' with Decree of Annihilation there is a 'all' quanitifier (inside or after conjunction_chain)

110. pr<top> ob<card> here top should be a quantifier

113. Life and Limb has two all quanitifiers.

114. Wandering Mage "...xp<player> or ch<planeswalker>..." How do we want to handle it?

'{t}: xa<add> {u} or {b}.\n{4}{u}{b}: ob<card ref=self> xa<become suffix=s> xq<a> ob<permanent characteristics=creature→(4/4∧blue∧black∧(artifact∧dragon))> pr<with> kw<flying> sq<until> ts<eot>.'
 we can unwrap the inner artifact&dragon

130. if we tag standalone characteristics as 'xr', we will have to change up how we treat objects

133. Jhoira's Timebug will cause problems

136, Need to figure out how to standarize the treatment of suffixes in status

137. Look at Sieges i.e. Monastery Siege, have to tag khans or dragons

140. should costs i.e. mana cost, activation cost be retagged as 'attributes'
