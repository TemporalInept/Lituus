26. Nissa's Defeat, Wasitora, Nekoru Queen and Chrome Mox highlight chaining problems/difficulties

a. Nissa has 3 distinct permanents a forest, a green enchantment and a green planeswalker where the quantifier target applies to each but these cannot be chained into a forest|green->enchantment|green->planeswalker (or could they) NOTE: there are no commas between green and enchantment

b. In Chrome Mox we see two characteristics that can be chained into a card object but there is a comma seperating them

c. Wasitora has multiple characterstics with no commas and one meta (p/t)

27. redo 'the' as a quanitifier?
