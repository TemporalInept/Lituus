# ![Lituus Logo](https://github.com/TemporalInept/Lituus/blob/master/docs/lituus%20banner.png)
## A parser and pseudo-scientific analyzer of MTG cards.

Lituus, a curved staff or wand used by Roman augurs to define a templum in the sky and interpret the passage of birds and divine omens.

## 1 DESCRIPTION

**NOTE: Lituus in its current state does not work**

Lituus is a proof of concept that aims to:

 1. Grab the characteristics of each card,
 2. Parse and graph Magic: The Gathering (MTG) oracle text,
 3. Compile and collate the parsed oracle text and card characteristics,
 3. Analyze the collated data in terms of Competitive Elder Highlander (cEDH) decks,
 5. and use the data in Ertai's Study of Lesser Wizards (ESoLW) <https://github.com/TemporalInept/ESoLW> Quarterly and Annual Reports. 

Sources:

 1. The MTG card database at <https://mtgjson.com> 
 2. AverageDragon's (<https://tappedout.net/users/AverageDragon/>) cEDH conglomerate at <http:cedh-decklist-database.xyz/primary.html>
 3. MTG Comprehensive Rules at <https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules>

Once complete, Lituus will be able to conceptualize oracle text as trees

<pre>
Dark Ritual
root
└ line:0
   └ability-line:0
    └spell-ability:0
     ├lituus-action-clause:0
     │├lituus-action:0(word=add)
     │└mana:0
     │ └mana-string:0(mana={b}{b}{b})
     └punctuation:0(symbol=.)
</pre>

which, when combined with other characterisitics of cards, will give us the tools to meet our objectives.

## 2 DEPENDENCIES

 1. **Python 3.x** It has only been tested on my machine using Python 3.5.2 is not guaranteed to work on anything else. I have no intention of trying to port it to Python 2.x
 2. **networkx** (https://networkx.github.io) to create parse trees
 3. **BeautifulSoup** (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for scraping online decklists
 4. **RegEx** (https://pypi.org/project/regex/)

## 3 BACKGROUND, OBJECTIVES AND CURRENT ISSUES
Lituus is a follow on to a personal project that attempted to create a program that could compare my decks to other decks (specifically cEDH) but, it became grossly unmaintable due to a mess of regular expressions and string finds. Furthermore, the final aim of Lituus is to compare cEDH decks to each other in a quantifiable way and programmatically discern their Archetypes which requires a more robust method.

The results of the current program can be found in ESoLW (<https://github.com/TemporalInept/ESoLW>). 


## 4 INSTALLATION/USING

Currently, Lituus has no "self install" capabilities. Once the parsing is stable and I moved the analyzing portion over, I'll work on the installation functuality. 

Until then, if you want to run Lituus, download and unzip <https://github.com/TemporalInept/Lituus/archive/master.zip> to your desired location. You can run Lituus directly from this location or add as .pth file to your Python site-packages directory (<https://docs.python.org/2/library/site.html>) and run Lituus from anywhere.
